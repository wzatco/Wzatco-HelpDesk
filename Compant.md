A Childhood Passion Sparks a Revolution
In 2017, two determined dreamers decided to transform their lifelong passion for electronics into something extraordinary. Frustrated by a market flooded with unbranded products, they left stable corporate roles behind to create a brand that stood out for quality and integrity.

They turned their modest 2BHK home in Bangalore into a creative hub, surrounded by wires, soldering irons, and blueprints. This was the birthplace of WZATCO—the place where their shared goal took shape: to deliver exceptional products and unmatched support for customers.

“Big dreams often begin in the smallest of spaces.”

Building Blocks of Dedication & Innovation
Fueled by determination, the founders assembled a team of passionate visionaries. Together, they faced every challenge—developing high-quality products that set new benchmarks in the industry. Each launch was marked by unwavering commitment and attention to detail. The WZATCO family grew, united by the goal of transforming every viewing experience into something memorable.

Amazing buy!
I had never owned a projector before, but I’d always wanted something compact and easy to use. I recently got the Yuva Go Pro Automatic, and it’s been performing exceptionally well. I project directly onto a wall, and the quality has been impressive. It’s been almost two months now, and after watching several movies, I can confidently say it’s been a worthwhile purchase.
